# A brief History of Artificial Intelligence

## Ancient Times and Middle Ages: Setting the Theoritical and Philosophical Grounds of AI

Reference: These notes summarise the Course material of DLBDSEAI01 Artificial Intelligence at the IUAS. 

The field of Artificial Intelligence has its roots in Ancient Ages with Greek Philosophers like Aristotle, who first tried to formalize human thinking in a way that made it possible to imitate and replicate it. In the Middle Ages, Leonardo da Vinci created a hypothetical machine on paper that was a black box, accepting an input and giving out output based on some program, stored in the memory of the machine. 

Later in the XVI century Hobbes and Descartes developed phylosophical theories about rationalism and how rationing is similar to materialism and calculus so it can be copied in machines. 

In the XVII century, David Hume did an extensive work on induction and reasoning. He said that our knowledge of the world is only empirical (what we have seen, what we have experienced, etc.). When we say that the Sun will rise tomorrow, it is because so far it has risen every day so far but there is no real reason why the past should resembles the future. However, most of reasoning is based on repeated exposure and experience (as in the case of an AI nowadays). 

## How Artificial Intelligence Developed as a Scientific Field
In 1950, Alan Turing formalised human thinking and defined his famous test: the turing test. The test describes a situation in which there are three participants in the interaction: a human judge, a human respondent and a machine (AI). The human judge doesn't know who answers the question (if it is the machine or the human). If the human judge can't distingish if it is the machine or the human, then the machine is considered real AI that passes the test. 

In 1956, there was the first AI conference where the term was coined by John McCarthy. He establishe AI as a separate field of study in a collaboration with the MIT and IBM in 1958. 

In 1959, Marvin Minsky started the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He combined AI with cognitive science. 

About the same time, the prominent linguist Noam Chomsky made advancements in formal language theory and the idea of universal grammar as well as Chomsky hirearchy that helped the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP). 

### Key AI institutions
The most prominent institutions in the past and nowadays, are MIT and Dartmouth College as well as IBM, Intel and American government-sponsored security projects and institutions. 

### Key disciplines contributing to AI research and development
There are 4 main disciplines that have contributed to the development of AI: 
- **Decision theory:** the field that combines mathematical probability and economic utility. This field helps AI make decisions based on uncertainty and trade-offs. It is the stydy of how agents make choices given some constraints, some available information, preferences and possible outcomes.
- **Game theory:** this field is very connected to AI especially in situations where AI should interact with other agents and make decisions based on the behavour of another agent (competitive or cooperative environments). For example, self-driving cars operate in a cooperative environment with other cars on the road or chess-players try to outsmart each other.
- **Neuroscience:**: the two fields of neuroscience and AI both seek to explain intelligence, cognition and reasoning and have influenced each other profoundly. A very obvious example is the creation of artificial neural networks that mimics the way the brain work. Just as the neurons in the human brain operate and strenghten or weaken connections between them so does an artifical neural network has 'neurons', organised in layers that are connected by weights that change over time with activity.
- **Linguistics:** this field is connected to AI in a subfield, called Natural LAnguage Processing that aims at making computers understand and replicate speech and written text. Examples include: context free grammars and dependency parsing that are used in AI models.

Historically, AI algorithms and programs were written mainly in Lisp (created by John McCarthy), later Prolog and now Python.
