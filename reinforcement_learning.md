There are three techniques in Machine learning to train a model: 
1. Supervised Learning:
   - you need a large labeled dataset
   - typical tasks: regression and classification
   - uses: spam detection, credit risk estimation, etc.  
2. Unsupervised Learning:
   - unlabeled data, algorithm must find underlying patterns
   - typical tasks: cluster analysis, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection
   - uses: to oraganise massive amounts of information like profiling website users, identify relevant peer groups, etc. 
3. Reinforcement Learning:
   - algorithms improve themselves by interacting with the environmen, no predefined data required. The agent learns on an unknown set of data by the rewards it gets from the environment
