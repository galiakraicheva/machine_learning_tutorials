Modern AI systems are present in every aspect of our lives even without us knowing about it. All these modern AI systems are weak systems. 

## Weak AI (Narrow AI) vs Strong AI (Artificial General Intelligence) 
**Weak AI:** is an AI system that is trained for a specific task and can't generalise out of the field that it is trained to. It may show superhuman problem-solving but only in one (or several) areas where it is trained. 

**Strong AI**: not created yet in the realms of fantasy so far. It is supposed to have knowledge across different domains and the whole spectrum of human cognitive abilities. It may have motivation and volition as well as self-awareness. It should have a perception of the whole environment. It may reach superhuman intelligence across all fields. It may be able to self-improve recursivly. 

## What are Modern AI Systems Used For? 

### Healthcare and Pharma: The Fastest Growing Area Adopting AI
- detects diseases
- monitior patients
- optimise perscriptions
- wearables can help monitoring, look for anomalies and call emergency if such appear

### Telecommunication and AI: 
- automates networks
- optimises networks
- checks networks' health and safety
- fixes networks before they get broken
- prevents fraudulent behaviour (trained on big data)

## Car Industries and AI: 
- sensors to the car to stay in lane
- emergency brakes
- technical problems sensors
- driver's risky behaviour (like fatigue, alcohol)
- self-driving features
- in production, ensures safe production line and assembly better than humans
