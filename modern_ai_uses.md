Modern AI systems are present in every aspect of our lives even without us knowing about it. All these modern AI systems are weak systems. 

## Weak AI (Narrow AI) vs Strong AI (Artificial General Intelligence) 
**Weak AI:** is an AI system that is trained for a specific task and can't generalise out of the field that it is trained to. It may show superhuman problem-solving but only in one (or several) areas where it is trained. 

**Strong AI**: not created yet in the realms of fantasy so far. It is supposed to have knowledge across different domains and the whole spectrum of human cognitive abilities. It may have motivation and volition as well as self-awareness. It should have a perception of the whole environment. It may reach superhuman intelligence across all fields. It may be able to self-improve recursivly.
